# **CJParse**

**CJParse** is a lightweight and portable C++ library for parsing and generating JSON, adhering to the [JSON Standard (*RFC 7159*)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7159).  

---

## **Features**

### **Parsing JSON**
- Converts any JSON string into a `CJParse` struct, containing all the contents of the JSON string.
- **Compact and portable**: The only dependency is the C++ Standard Library.
- **Internal Classes**:
  - A dedicated parser for handling JSON strings.
  - A generator for creating JSON strings with customization options.
  
### **Future Enhancements**
- Error handling: Trace parsing errors down to the exact line and character (**planned**).
