# CJParse   
JSON standard this lib follows is: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7159

CJParse is a library written in c++ to parse any json file into a CJParse struct containing all the original contents parsed into memory exactly as they appear in the JSON file, following the above mentioned JSON standard.

At this moment (Dec 21st, 2024) it does not have error handling or any type of exception or termination.
Will add these features soon.
